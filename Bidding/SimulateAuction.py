    Simulate an English (ascending) auction for multiple items with carry-over budgets.

    Each item is auctioned sequentially:
      - Budgets roll over between items, so spending on earlier items reduces capacity later.
      - Start at START_PRICE; at each increment, players drop out when price > valuation or budget.
      - Last remaining bidder wins and pays the current price.
